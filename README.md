# Binary-Image-Segmentation
Binary Image segmentation is the process of classifying the pixels of an image into two categories: pixels belonging to the foreground objects of an image and pixels belonging to the background objects of an image. Image segmentation is an important problem in image processing and computer vision with many application ranging from background substraction and removal to object tracking, etc. While there are many ways to model this problem mathematically, the one used for this is a min-cut finding problem with multiple sources and sinks. In this project, implemented a simple binary image segmentation technique using min-cut and the OpenCV library.

The program has 3 arguments: an input image, a configuration file that provides the initial set of foreground and background points and an output image. Program computes the binary segmentation of the pixels in the input image based on the initial segmentation provided in the configuration file. The output is an image of the same size of the input image such that each pixel is either white (foreground) or black (background).
